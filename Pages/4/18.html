            <p>The first doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine have touched down in Australia as preparations continue for
                the first stage of the national rollout, Health Minister Greg Hunt says.</p>
    
            <p>People will begin receiving the vaccine from Monday, February 22, with more than 142,000 doses arriving in
                Sydney just after midday today.</p>
    
            <p>“They will now be subject to security, quality assurance, in particular to ensure that temperature
                maintenance has been preserved throughout the course of the flight, to ensure the integrity of the doses,
                and to ensure there has been no damage,” Mr Hunt said.</p>
    
            <p>The vaccine has to be kept between -60 and -90 degrees Celsius.</p>
    
            <p>The Government is releasing 80,000 doses of the vaccine next week, with 50,000 going to states and
                territories to vaccinate frontline quarantine and health workers, and 30,000 to aged care and disability
                care residents and workers.</p>

            <p>Health Minister Greg Hunt said the <a href="#">rollout would start with</a> 80,000 jabs per week, “if not
                more”.</p>
    
            <p>The Government was expecting to be briefed by Pfizer on supply beyond March in mid-February.</p>
    
            <p>Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy said Australia faced “major logistics issues” vaccinating the <a

            <p>The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus-70 degrees Celsius.</p>
